      <h3>

        Hello World,
</h3>
 <br/>
I'm Kevin George.
<br/>
<h4>
I'm passionate about Electronics and Engineering. When I was younger, I was passionate about tinkering and programming. I used to take apart devices and study the electronics behind it.
<br/>
As I got older I tried to become more and more familiar with computers and electronics, joining my High School's FIRST TECH CHALLENGE Robotics Team.
<br/>
Then I wanted to turn this into a career and set out to become an engineer. I studied at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and got my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology.
<br/>
While at NJIT, I became a member of the student chapter of the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/"> Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a>, slowly rising up to become Secretary, Vice President and then President of the chapter.
<br/>
I also became President of the <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org">IEEE-HKN Gamma Kappa Chapter</a> as well.
<br/>
I interned at Crestron Electronics as a Test Engineer in the Summer of 2020 and joined ZT Systems in Winter 2020 as a Scale Test Engineer.
